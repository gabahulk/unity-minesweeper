A minesweeper project to study unity

## Project questions and doubts

This section will be reserved to questions that were raised and that the members had during the development

### Resources folder
	Why use the resources folder and should this project use it?
	
	The resources folder, crudely speaking, is only used for large assets that are creating a bottleneck on loading times. Since this game is rather small, there's little to no sense using it, as it has a obtuse API when compared to the simpler flow of assets inside unity. If in another project you have the need to optimize your asset load times, check this [link](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/assets-resources-and-assetbundles) from Unity
